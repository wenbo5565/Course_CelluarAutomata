# Celluar Automata Model for Air Traffic Control

This repository includes my python code to implement Celluar Automata model for air traffic control. 
The goal of this work is not to study the model or paper. Instead the implementation is part of the requirement for course High Performance Computing and Parallel computing.

Paper

* The paper was written by Charles Kim and it can be accessed at [Celluar Automata Modeling of Automous Aircrafts](http://www.mwftr.com/CA/ATCA2005_18-3.pdf)

Code

* [Serial version in python](https://github.com/wenbo5565/Course_CelluarAutomata/blob/master/CA_AutonomousAircrafts_Serial.py) The serial version in Python
* [Parallel version in python](https://github.com/wenbo5565/Course_CelluarAutomata/blob/master/ca_parallel.py) - The parallel version (MPI) is implemented with mpi4py in Python and has been tested with 4 cores.
* path on DSRL is at /home/wenboma/Course_CelluarAutomata

Note
* VNC is needed to see the animation result.
